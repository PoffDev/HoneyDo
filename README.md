HoneyDo, is the world's first socialable task manager. HoneyDo makes those boring, stupid, chore lists both fun and rewarding. The idea is simple, create a "HoneyDo" list for your hunny, assigning a "BrowniePoints" value for each task, and create a "Rewards" lisst. As your hunny starts to knock off HoneyDo's their Brownie Points will start to add up. Once enough BrowniePoints are accumulated your hunny can trade them in for rewards. The tasks and rewards are limitless, the only limits are your imagination!
